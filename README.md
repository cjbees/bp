Bipolar Disorder in the Media: Fiction versus Reality

Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition, affecting about 2.6% of the US population each year -- between 7 and 8 million people. Bipolar is treatable, but since it can disrupt people’s day-to-day lives, it is considered a severe condition.

With the release of Touched with Fire, Harmony Institute became interested in how mental illness, particularly bipolar disorder, is depicted in the media. We conducted an extensive search and watched dozens of films, TV shows, and made-for-TV-movies, classifying each character’s behavior, their storylines, and how central bipolar disorder was to the plot. We wanted to understand how bipolar disorder contributes to stories being told, and how future creative projects can provide a more complete picture of the lives of people with bipolar disorder. 

In addition to analysis on how bipolar disorder is portrayed in the media, we also wanted to see whether there was a relationship between the prominence of the disorder in a story and the story’s reception. We looked at our dataset of 66 films, which collectively feature 117 characters with bipolar disorder, and plotted each film using two scores: one on the level of bipolar disorder-related content, and one on the level of public and critical attention received. 

Bipolar content (1-7)

Coders judged how central bipolar disorder was to the plot of a piece of media by considering the length of time the disorder was featured, whether major events in the plot were tied to bipolar disorder, and whether bipolar disorder caused lasting repercussions for characters. One coder rated all 66 titles, and a second rated 25 of the 66 titles. Ratings were highly correlated, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Attention (0-7)

A film’s attention score was calculated using a ‘points’ system: we considered the length of time since its release (more recent releases resulted in more points), Box Office returns for films, or U.S. television ratings for TV series or made-for-TV movies (higher box office or ratings resulted in more points), and whether it received major awards (winning or being nominated for major awards resulted in a point). 

Overall, bipolar content was negatively correlated with attention -- pieces that were prominently featured bipolar disorder tended to receive less attention.  

For example, most of the documentaries are clustered in the upper left - they were primarily about bipolar disorder, but this focus appeared to serve a small, specific audience. Films that had a wide audience, including Shutter Island and The Perfect Guy, tended to include bipolar disorder as only a small detail in the story.  

However, four titles in particular -- Shameless, Silver Linings Playbook, Empire, and Homeland -- bucked the group trend, garnering attention while bipolar disorder remained central to the plot. The disorder touches on characters’ relationships, careers, goals, and was not isolated to one ‘very special episode’ or their sole distinguishing feature.

To explore the data, hover over the dots below. For in-depth information on how we collected and analyzed the data, read “Bipolar Disorder in the Media: Fiction vs Reality.” (excerpt below)


The Data
Our goal was to capture how bipolar disorder has been presented to Americans in the media, so we cast a broad search. We searched for “bipolar disorder” and “manic depression” in Google, on IMDB, and in academic databases; we looked at compilations from websites which address mental health and bipolar disorder, forums about bipolar disorder, crowdsourced lists from Wikipedia, and personal suggestions.

Based on this initial list of 104 media titles, we excluded titles that were not film, TV show, or TV movies (for example, comic books, novels, the Tony-award winning play ‘Next to Normal’); titles that were not broadcast in the US (for example, the UK program ‘Shameless’ was excluded, although the US version, airing on Showtime, was); and titles in which the character’s diagnosis was never stated to be bipolar disorder (For example, some accounts identified the protagonist in Prozac Nation as bipolar, but only depression was mentioned in the film). 

This criterion for figuring out if a character was bipolar was surprisingly tricky. We did not consider the medical accuracy of depictions, merely whether someone said the character had bipolar disorder or was manic depressive; or was seen or mentioned taking lithium, since it is so tightly linked as a treatment for bipolar disorder. For “Love & Mercy”, a biopic about Brian Wilson, characters mention other diagnoses, but title cards at the end of the film reveal that those were incorrect. Biographical information about Mr. Wilson highlighted bipolar disorder, so we decided to keep the film in the sample.

We also did not consider public figures who are well known for having bipolar disorder, or advocates for bipolar disorder. While high-profile individuals are often central to the public’s awareness about specific issues, we focused on the content and effects of intentionally crafted media, since the lines between individual’s experience and role as a spokesperson become blurred, especially if the disclosure of a person’s medical information was not intentional.

We found this editing process informative from a qualitative point of view. Pieces of media that landed on a number of recommendation lists, like Blue Sky (1994), Frances (1982), and Shine (1996), never explicitly mention bipolar disorder. And although we didn’t consider clinical criteria, there seemed to be widespread confusion about what bipolar disorder is, how it affects individuals, and how it’s different from schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder.

After editing, our dataset included 67 titles, and 119 characters. Since it inspired the project, we also excluded Touched with Fire, leaving 66 titles and 117 characters.

Once we had converged on a set of media titles, we gathered information about each item’s release, its genre, social media presence, awards, and box office returns or Nielsen ratings. We also identified each character with bipolar disorder, made judgments about each character’s gender, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as well as whether they played a Major or Supporting role in the plot, or were only mentioned and never seen onscreen. 

We also judged how central bipolar disorder was to the plot of the piece of media on a scale of 1 to 7; documentaries like Boy Interrupted or Flight from Madness received the highest possible score of 7, but Urban Legend or Prison Break were primarily about other things -- bipolar disorder was incidental to the story, so received 1, the lowest rating.

The distribution of depictions was not even over time - most of this sample came from the last 15 years, with notable exceptions like an episode of Maude (1976), and the TV-Film In the Best Interest of the Children (1992). Several TV series introduced different characters over the years, like ER’s Maggie, in 2000, and Eric, in 2002. 

The Demographics

Do bipolar characters in the media represent people living with bipolar disorder in real life? 

In some ways, yes -- bipolar disorder affects men and women equally, and this sample includes a nearly-even split of men (N = 56, or 47.9% of the sample) and women (N = 61, 52%) depicted in the media. However, male characters with bipolar disorder were more likely to have a major role in the piece of media (N = 33 out of 49 Major Characters), while female characters were more likely to play a supporting role (N = 42 out of 63 Supporting Characters). Of the five characters who were only mentioned and never seen onscreen, three were (assumed to be) women and two were men.

Bipolar disorder also affects racial and ethnic groups equally, but (to the best of our ability to judge racial and ethnic identification), characters in the media are overwhelmingly Caucasian (N = 105, 89.7%), with only 8 characters presented as Black or African American, 1 Hispanic or Latin@ character, 1 Native Canadian, and 2 whose racial/ethnic identity could not be determined. Documentaries and fictional pieces of media were equally lacking in diversity.

In one large scale study, relative household income (low, low-average, high-average, high) was not associated with bipolar disorder. We coded characters’ socioeconomic status as high, middle, or low, based on what was presented about their income, occupation and status of that occupation, and level of education. That largest number of characters (56) were depicted as middle socioeconomic status, followed by high (37), and low (22), with 2 we were unable to code. This was a relatively even split, not a significant difference between the three groups. 

The Action

We also gathered as much information as possible about what each bipolar character did in their storylines. Again, this process itself was informative -- actions associated with bipolar characters were almost overwhelmingly negative. 

Although individuals in documentaries like Stephen Fry: The secret life of the manic depressive and Up/Down talked about how being bipolar made them who they are, and they wouldn’t change it if they could, it was difficult to tie specific activities to those feelings. Even discussions of having a specific perspective, resilience, or behaviors like productivity and creative inspiration were tempered by discussions of these activities as symptoms. 
We focused on six actions or behaviors that were depicted in many pieces of media, and were also documented in research about bipolar disorder, namely: attempting or committing suicide, violent or aggressive behavior, abuse of drugs or alcohol, losing a job or getting kicked out of school, inappropriate/excessive sexual behavior, and being dissatisfied or going off of medication. We also looked at differences for each depiction for men versus women, fictional versus documentary titles, and major, supporting, or mentioned characters. 

Suicide

Bipolar disorder has been noted as one of the most deadly mental illnesses. A recent, nationally representative study recorded 25%, or one in 4 people with Bipolar I, attempts suicide. More than half of the characters in this set attempted or committed suicide (61 out of 117, or 52.1%). This also varied by character role; all 5 of the character who were mentioned but did not appear onscreen were associated with suicide, and major characters were more likely to have attempted suicide than not (30 attempted/committed suicide, versus 14 no attempt).

This is a grim observation; media depictions appear to significantly over represent the suicidality of bipolar characters, compared to individuals in real life. 


Violence

Depictions of violence or aggressive behavior, including physical fights, reckless driving that puts others in danger, or biting people, were common; 44 characters, or 38% of the sample, depicted violent or aggressive behavior. More men showed violent behavior than women, a difference which was more pronounced in documentaries than fiction. 
 As one report states, “Most patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are not violent. Nevertheless, the risk of violence in patients with these disorders is greater than in the general population.” (9). In reality, people with bipolar disorder are more likely to have incidents of violent behavior (Studies range from 12-16% of samples) than those who do not have bipolar disorder (Studies range from 0.51% - .66% of general populations); and men are more likely to report violent behavior than women (5.8% versus 1.4%), and 

In our sample, men are more likely to be depicted as violent and aggressive than women (53% of male characters, versus 31% of female characters). Our definition of violence was more lenient than the published definition, which may account for some of the discrepancy --  but depictions of bipolar appear to include violent behavior more often than reality.

Although we did not explicitly collect data on the type of violence, it also seemed like the type of violent behavior depended on gender: men seemed to be involved in more confrontations and fistfights, while female characters’ violence involved reckless driving, violence toward children, or in the case of Sylvia Plath in Sylvia, biting her future husband’s face at a party.

Drugs and Alcohol

Just under a third of characters were depicted abusing drugs or alcohol; this was more common for men than women, especially when considering documentaries versus fictional media.

Job Loss

It was also relatively common for characters to lose a job or get kicked out of school, which occurred to 45 characters, or 38% of the sample. This was especially common for men, in fictional pieces of media. 


Inappropriate or Excessive Sexual Behavior

In more than a quarter of this sample (32 characters, or 27%), characters showed inappropriate or excessive sexual behavior, including pursuing sex more often than usual, in public locations, with multiple partners, or even (in 90210), filming a sexual encounter and presenting it in a theater. Neither men nor women were particularly explicit about this type of behavior in documentaries, but just under half of all women in fictional media (15 out of 33 characters, 45%) showed this kind of behavior, while it was less common for men (11 out of 29, 38%).




Medication

“Going off the medication” was a very common part of depictions of bipolar in both fictional media (35 fictional characters, or 66%) and documentaries (26 documentary characters, or 51%), for both men and women. 



Media has to be dramatic; we didn’t account for the baseline rates of depictions of attempted suicides, or sexual behavior, for example. It’s hard to say how these depictions compare to norms for media, as opposed to the research about real individuals. 

But we find several patterns alarming: emphasizing negative features of the disorder, potentially at the expense of a fuller picture of the character’s life; potentially amplifying gender stereotypes; depicting mostly caucasian, high- or middle- socioeconomic status individuals; and for portraying a confused version of what bipolar symptoms are, often used as a plot device or to explain extreme behavior. The patterns that we’ve observed so far are alarming, but the exceptional examples are also enlightening: the portrayals that have gotten a combination of high attention and feature bipolar disorder as a central part of the story (Silver Linings Playbook, Homeland, Empire, and Shameless) are all-around strong pieces of media.
